# Email

For professional (academic or consulting) and media inquiries you can reach me at [mthieu -at- emory -dot- edu](mailto:mthieu@emory.edu).

Unfortunately I cannot respond to fan mail, but I appreciate the thought!

# Tipping (if you found my posts useful)

I put coding tips and tutorials on my blog for free so that they can reach anyone who might find them useful! These blog posts do take a non-negligible amount of time to write. If my work has helped you in any way, I will happily accept a small tip if you have the financial resources.

# Twitter

I used to post about stats/science on occasion @[monica_too_](https://twitter.com/monica_too_), but I have stepped away from Twitter since it was taken private. :(
