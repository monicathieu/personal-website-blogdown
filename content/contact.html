<p>For professional (academic or consulting) and media inquiries you can reach me at <a href="mailto:mthieu@emory.edu">mthieu -at- emory -dot- edu</a>.</p>

<h1>Tipping (if you found my posts useful)</h1>
<p>I put coding tips and tutorials on my blog for free so that they can reach anyone who might find them useful! These blog posts do take a non-negligible amount of time to write. If my work has helped you in any way, I will happily accept a small tip if you have the financial resources.</p>
