      <description>As a teacher-scholar, my teaching development has been intertwined with my development as a researcher. In particular, I have learned about the ways in which effective research and teaching do not come from “eureka” moments of intellectual brilliance, but, instead, depend on thoughtful planning and structures that support success from the bottom up. Just as rigorous study design and statistical analysis are necessary to answer a research question, positive early experiences and supportive course structures are necessary for students to enter a discipline and thrive within it.</description>

&lt;p&gt;As a teacher-scholar, my teaching development has been intertwined with my development as a researcher. In particular, I have learned about the ways in which effective research and teaching do not come from “eureka” moments of intellectual brilliance, but, instead, depend on thoughtful planning and structures that support success from the bottom up. Just as rigorous study design and statistical analysis are necessary to answer a research question, positive early experiences and supportive course structures are necessary for students to enter a discipline and thrive within it. I focus on designing and teaching introductory classes, where I can inspire new students to study psychology and scientific computing. In those classes, I implement accessible course policies to sustain student success throughout the semester. Finally, I maintain comprehensive course materials to standardize my pedagogy and share those materials to support my peers’ teaching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I strive to nurture novice scientists’ critical thinking skills in introductory courses.&lt;/strong&gt; Intro-level instructors have the privilege and responsibility of serving as the welcome committee for students entering a new academic discipline. Psychology in particular can serve as a gateway to STEM for students curious about human behavior, and as a core college STEM experience for students fulfilling breadth requirements. I am committed to balancing the needs of these two groups of students through intro psych classes that are rigorous yet accessible. For example, I collaborated with Dr. Caroline Marvin in developing a new team-based introductory psychology course (“The Science of Psychology: Explorations &amp;amp; Applications”) taught for the first time in spring 2021. I helped select readings, develop lesson plans, and draft assignments, paying special attention to craft learning objectives and structure assignments in a way that was simultaneously appropriate for prospective psychology/neuroscience majors and for general-education students. For instance, I helped build units around applied “challenges” that grouped psychological concepts based on real-world significance. For example, one unit combined concepts from perception and infant/child development, which are not commonly grouped together in introductory psychology courses or textbooks, in the context of masked in-person vs. remote learning strategies for COVID safety in schools (see Thieu et al., 2022, Journal of College Science Teaching for a summary and reflection of our work). I then taught the course as instructor of record in summer 2022, further refining the course to take advantage of summer course structure. For example, during the class on perception, groups of students broke down the results and figures from papers on emotion recognition from face vs. body, and during the class on development, groups practiced writing a “grant” to extend findings from rodent research on infant-maternal attachment to humans. During the final class of the unit, groups used evidence from pre-class readings and in-class activities to propose a hypothetical elementary school’s COVID policy, arguing for masked in-person, remote, or hybrid learning. I leveraged the longer summer class meetings to allow students to engage more deeply with the material via the activities, all while I was able to assess their learning by observing their group work. By the end of the course, students reflected positively on the skills and content they planned to apply back to their work in other majors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going beyond content, &lt;strong&gt;I build accessibility into my course policies to sustain student success.&lt;/strong&gt; For example, psychology students entering quantitative courses may come in with little to no experience using scientific computing tools like R to analyze data, but a commitment to learning given sufficient support. Accordingly, an accessible grading structure will scaffold students’ learning by rewarding incremental progress and learning from feedback. As a curriculum developer and instructor, I have designed assignment submission and grading policies that allow students flexibility in managing their own deadlines, without penalizing students who need more practice but ultimately achieve the same learning objectives. For example, as instructor for Stats II in Psychology at Spelman College in spring 2024, I designed a two-stage system where each weekly problem set was eligible for full-credit revisions, with no late or resubmission penalty, if revised within one week of receiving the initial grade and feedback. I designed this structure to incentivize students to engage with my feedback and improve their work to meet learning objectives, without penalizing students for first-round mistakes. At the same time, the revision structure allowed me to grade more rigorously on the first pass and hold students to higher standards, knowing that they would have the opportunity to respond to my feedback for full credit. Finally, the time-limited nature of the problem set revisions encouraged students to stay on top of their work through the course, while protecting me as the instructor from a buildup of revision submissions at the end of the term. Over half of students completed at least one revision and raised their problem set grade, showing that students indeed made use of the system. In this way, I was able to leverage course logistics to support student learning, especially for a quantitative course where students might bring insecurity about their own abilities into the classroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, in order to codify effective teaching practices and make them repeatable across terms and instructors, &lt;strong&gt;I create and refine detailed teaching materials that persist and evolve after my involvement with a course.&lt;/strong&gt; For example, as a lab instructor for the Spelman College Women in STEM six-week intensive program for incoming first-years in summer 2023, I developed and taught a project-based data science course. Students first completed a crash course in data cleaning and visualization techniques using R, and then each student conducted an independent data science analysis—designing their own research question, sourcing their own publicly available datasets, identifying patterns in their data, and presenting their results. I created all lesson plans and course materials natively in R and managed a course workspace in RStudio Cloud for students to complete exercises and conduct their analyses. The course’s R integration made it easy to format course materials for storage and sharing. For example, on my end, I published the syllabus, course schedule, and lecture notes online as a public website using GitHub and Netlify, both for student reference and to share with other instructors and interested parties. On students’ end, they were able to export their summer work and re-publish their projects in their own GitHub coding portfolios, bringing the technical integration full-circle. In this way, I applied my technical expertise not only to support student learning during a single course but also to create a persistent store for course materials on which my peers and I can build in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, I work to make the discipline I love interesting and accessible to students through introductory psychology courses, research methods and statistics courses, and introductory programming workshops. I design those classes not only to inspire students through content but to set them up for success through supportive course policies. In those courses, I support my own and my peers’ future teaching by creating, maintaining, and documenting teaching materials that save time, keep record of successful teaching strategies, and support future innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Introduction Selected feedback Clear handling of complex topics Energy and enthusiasm Clear and prompt written feedback Introduction Collected below are a series of free-form testimonials about my teaching effectiveness. For my official teaching assistantships, I have excerpted comments about various aspects of my teaching from official TA-specific teaching evaluations (original documents available upon request). I note that for my coding boot camp instructorships, students were not prompted to give instructor-specific feedback, so I have fewer student comments from those teaching experiences, but I have included a few testimonials that I do have, where relevant.</description>

&lt;h1&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collected below are a series of free-form testimonials about my teaching effectiveness. For my official teaching assistantships, I have excerpted comments about various aspects of my teaching from official TA-specific teaching evaluations (original documents available upon request). I note that for my coding boot camp instructorships, students were not prompted to give instructor-specific feedback, so I have fewer student comments from those teaching experiences, but I have included a few testimonials that I do have, where relevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comments are organized into three themes: my skills in breaking down complex topics, my energy in the classroom, and my clear, prompt, and actionable formative written feedback on assignments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Clear handling of complex topics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Thieu did a very excellent job at making sure we understood the course information without feeling too overwhelmed or confused. &lt;em&gt;(Statistics II in Psychology, Spring 2024, Spelman College)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Thieu knows her stuff! You can tell she really knows the subject matter, and can answer questions in a relatable modern way. &lt;em&gt;(Science of Psychology: Explorations &amp;amp; Applications, Summer 2022, Columbia University)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was very impressed how [she was] able to keep an eye on the chat, walk through the material, and switch to focusing on areas students were struggling, and in an absolutely relaxed way, which given that the material was new to people, was the perfect approach for a positive learning environment. &lt;em&gt;(Supervisor comment, Foundations for Research Computing bootcamp, Winter 2022, Columbia University)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, Monica’s pacing was superb. She explained every step in great detail without lingering too long on any one point. Because she explained everything she typed, it was very easy not only to understand how the results were attained, but also why each step was chosen over any other option. Such clear explanations help students retain the information and, hopefully, make similar connections for themselves in their future projects. &lt;em&gt;(Teaching observation, Wrangling Multilevel Data in the Tidyverse coding workshop, Spring 2022, Columbia University)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monica’s teaching and discussion leading skills are great. She was very friendly and facilitated really fun and interactive class activities to introduce some of the topics we were discussing and was also great at helping to explain concepts when asked about them in class. &lt;em&gt;(Science of Psychology: Explorations &amp;amp; Applications, Spring 2021, Columbia University)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monica was a great TA: very approachable, clearly walked us through assignment requirements and expectations, taught us to code R in a straightforward and helpful manner, and maintained a positive and enthusiastic attitude throughout. &lt;em&gt;(Research Methods, Fall 2019, Columbia University)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She also took on the daunting job of teaching non-CompSci students the basics of coding in R, and did it very well. I actually ended up enjoying the coding parts of the lab sections. &lt;em&gt;(Research Methods, Fall 2018, Columbia University)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monica Thieu is a fantastic instructor, I never felt like I didn’t understand something or couldn’t do an assignment for class because Monica was great at explaining the material and finding new ways of understanding the material. &lt;em&gt;(Research Methods, Fall 2018, Columbia University)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monica was a wonderful TA. She was very knowledgeable and good at explaining things, and was very available to provide help that was indeed helpful. She was also engaging in terms of leading discussions. &lt;em&gt;(Research Methods, Fall 2018, Columbia University)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;energy-and-enthusiasm&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Energy and enthusiasm&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was very engaging and promoted an open/welcoming environment where everyone felt safe to participate. &lt;em&gt;(Science of Psychology: Explorations &amp;amp; Applications, Summer 2022, Columbia University)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monica kept my enthusiasm up by validating how I felt about programming environments while also conveying information in a way that encouraged asking questions and problem-solving. &lt;em&gt;(Foundations for Research Computing bootcamp, Winter 2022, Columbia University)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monica was a very clear speaker, and she had a very uplifting and upbeat energy. &lt;em&gt;(Science of Psychology: Explorations &amp;amp; Applications, Spring 2021, Columbia University)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She’s an amazing leader and teacher. She takes charge and I can definitely see her becoming a teacher one day, she just has the natural instincts of one. &lt;em&gt;(Science of Psychology: Explorations &amp;amp; Applications, Spring 2021, Columbia University)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monica is such a fun and knowledgeable TA, I anticipate she will be a great teacher if she chooses to do so. She is very organized and manages to provide prompt feedback on assignments and foster a fun and engaging classroom environment. &lt;em&gt;(Science of Psychology: Explorations &amp;amp; Applications, Spring 2021, Columbia University)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monica is a natural teacher and it’s VERY apparent that she has a passion for research. She’s absolutely fantastic! &lt;em&gt;(Research Methods, Fall 2019, Columbia University)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monica is the best TA I’ve ever had! She’s easygoing, was super passionate about the topic (which I don’t think is common in a Research Methods TA), and was always well prepared for leading sections. &lt;em&gt;(Research Methods, Fall 2018, Columbia University)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;clear-and-prompt-written-feedback&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Clear and prompt written feedback&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The instructor provides really helpful feedback on the problem sets. &lt;em&gt;(Statistics II in Psychology, Spring 2024, Spelman College)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Always helpful and a quick grader as well. Her feedback was also very helpful &lt;em&gt;(Science of Psychology: Explorations &amp;amp; Applications, Spring 2021, Columbia University)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monica’s feedback has always been very informative and helpful in terms of knowing what you might’ve missed/haven’t understood in the assignments. &lt;em&gt;(Science of Psychology: Explorations &amp;amp; Applications, Spring 2021, Columbia University)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her feedback on my assignments was always helpful and clear. &lt;em&gt;(Research Methods, Fall 2019, Columbia University)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She returned assignments promptly and was fair in her grading, explaining any deductions. &lt;em&gt;(Research Methods, Fall 2018, Columbia University)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;syllabus&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Syllabus&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a prototype syllabus for &lt;em&gt;Intro to Programming for Behavioral Scientists&lt;/em&gt; that I designed as part of the Columbia Center for Teaching and Learning’s Innovative Course Design Seminar. The class has not yet been taught and I have not prepared curriculum for it, but I would like to offer it in the future!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My overarching goal in designing this syllabus was to lower barriers to student learning, and publicize that goal to students. I expect students to enter my class with no coding experience, and likely an aversion to math &amp;amp; programming topics. I want students to come away from the class believing that programming tools, when wielded properly, are key to producing strong psychological science, and that anyone can produce strong psychological science because anyone can program. While the syllabus definitely won’t achieve all of these goals on its own, it can help set an inclusive tone. I decided to format the syllabus as a website because I felt that would make it visually enticing and readable, and because the website format facilitates posting of R code lecture notes into the same site, allowing the site to be a one-stop reference shop for course info.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried to use an informal but informative tone while writing up course policies to keep those policies clear to all students, irrespective of English language background. In describing those policies, I tried to mention my rationale behind those policies where possible, so that students would understand that all policies, including those that might seem punitive (like not accepting late assignments without prior claiming of a deadline extension), are designed to support student learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also paid special attention to crafting the following policies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grading:&lt;/strong&gt; Encouraging students to improve their work based on feedback, and use tokens to manage their own deadline extension needs, no questions asked&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Equipment:&lt;/strong&gt; Reinforcing that students should not self-select out of the class for not having the “right” computer, or a sufficiently expensive one&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Communication:&lt;/strong&gt; Spelling out what students should include in help request emails to help them think through their code issue and help me identify their problem quickly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://sleepy-wing-5b36af.netlify.app/&#34;&gt;Syllabus website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;lesson-plan&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Lesson plan&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a lesson plan for the lab course associated with Research Methods in Psychology, taught in the Columbia psychology department. Approximately 13-17 students are typically enrolled in each lab section. This particular lesson is taught in week 6 of the 13-week semester.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I TA’d this class in fall 2019, I expanded all lab outlines from basic bullet-point lists of procedural guidelines into full objective-driven lesson plans. I included this lesson plan to illustrate my lesson plan design style. I strive to make lesson plans &lt;strong&gt;comprehensive,&lt;/strong&gt; like a cross between a textbook and a stage manager’s run sheet. In addition to a distinct learning objective, each lab module in the lesson has a timestamp with a suggested run time (and sub-timestamps for longer modules), as well as point-by-point instructions on how to run the module. My junior PhD student colleagues who TA’d the class after me reported using my lesson plans like a textbook, allowing them to quickly parse lab objectives, understand why activities were structured and timed the way they were, and glean procedural tips on how to run the activities. The lessons served not only to structure my own teaching, but also to train the TAs who came after me and to standardize instruction across their sections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;mini-lecture-video&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Mini-lecture video&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a mini-lecture video for Science of Psychology: Explorations and Applications, a semi-flipped class taught in the Columbia psychology department. When we taught the class online in spring 2021, 29 students were enrolled in the class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This video, which illustrates how the brain processes visual information, was assigned along with pre-class readings on visual perception. I included this lesson plan to illustrate how I work with the affordances offered by the teaching environment when creating learning content. I created this animated video to teach a highly visual topic (illustrating neuroanatomy and examples of perceptual information) using visual tools better suited to asynchronous video than synchronous lecture. Students enjoyed watching the video, found the concepts clear (as demonstrated in subsequent reading quizzes and in-class activities), and appreciated being able to pause and replay them at their own pace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;problem-set&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Problem set&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an interactive R problem set for Intro to Programming in R, taught in the Columbia business school. Approximately 40-50 students are typically enrolled in the class. This particular assignment is assigned week 2 and due week 3 of the 6-week half-semester term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I TA’d this class in fall 2021, I rewrote weeks 1-3’s assignments to run as interactive browser-based R exercises using the learnr package, instead of their previous form as R Markdown assignments. The key difference between the new and old assignment format is that in their old R Markdown form, students needed to correctly specify a number of technically unrelated code commands (loading packages, document metadata parameters, etc) and correctly implement programming syntax (spelling function and variable names correctly, initializing variables before they are called later, etc.) in order for their documents to render for submission. If there was a syntax error in one answer, the entire document would not render, even if the other answers were correct. In previous semesters of the class, I found that students became frustrated and demoralized when they could not render their homework documents because of such syntax errors, especially when it turned out that one error blocked the entire document from rendering. I realized that familiarity with programming syntax principles was unreasonable to expect students to have mastered that early in the class (and honestly, likely to take many months, if not years, to truly master!). I wanted to rework the first three assignments to run using an engine that would ease their dependence on syntax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two main benefits to the new assignment engine. First, each question runs individually, so a syntax error in one question does not block finishing the rest of the assignment. Second, package loading and other programming setup are handled under the hood, so students no longer have to specify those in order to submit their assignments. Later assignments in the term are still administered as R Markdown documents, so students are assessed on those skills after they have had more experience. However, by removing earlier assignments’ dependence on those skills, I brought the assignments more in line with the expected temporal progression toward course learning objectives.&lt;/p&gt;
